Think harder and come up with a development-plan for the following feature: $ARGUMENTS

Then create a detailed GitHub issue with full technical specifications. Specify that the code should follow these standards:

- **Typesafety Isn't Optional**: Everything must be end-to-end type-safe
- **Simplicity over Complexity**: "It's easy to fall into the trap of 'adding everything' - we explicitly don't want to do that"
- **Bleed Responsibly**: Use cutting-edge tech, but in the right places
- **Speed is a Superpower**: Optimize for developer velocity and shipping fast
- **Server Actions are cool**: Whenever possible use a server action instead of an API route
